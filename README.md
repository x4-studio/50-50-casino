"50-50 casino" experiment.
--------------------------
The essence of the problem: a man has 10 coins. Every day he spends 1 coin for his existence (if they run out - death).
Thus, if the coins are inactive, he has enough to live for 10 days. 
Besides, waiting to die, a man can play in a casino with a 50-50 chance. 
If the subject loses - he gives 1 coin to the casino and spends 1 coin to life (-2 in 24 hours).
If he wins - gets 2 coins, one spends on life ( 1 in 24 hours). 
---------------------------------------------------------------
My goal is to collect statistics and see how good the risk is.
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to repeat this experiment on more attempts (I have tested a maximum of 10 million cycles), 
you will change the value of the "cells" variable to a larger one (you can also change it to a smaller one, 
but the more the better the statistics are).

But remember, my task has an idealistic environment that does not and will not exist in real life.
The only thing that proves my experiment is acting better than doing nothing.
